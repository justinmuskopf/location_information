# location_information

A simple tool to query the ipstack API for location information, and get the results as a dicitonary object.
An API key from `api.ipstack.com` is required for use, and should be placed by default into `key.txt` in the same directory. Alternatively, the Locator object can be handed the API key in its constructor.
